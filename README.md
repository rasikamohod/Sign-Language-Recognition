# Sign-Language-Recognition
In this project, we implemented Microsoft XBOX Kinect SDK to capture 3D live motion and real-time gestures performed by the users. We then Compared the captured gestures with existing models coded in C# to recognize the most correct match and generate the corresponding speech output using the System.Speech library in Visual Studio.
